# CPP Cgo test

## Use
Cd to cpp and run make.  You should get no warnings, and, there should be a test executiable that you can run.  It will instantiate some handles and display them.

Cd back to top directory.  go build should make you an executiable, that should instantiate one handle, allow you to run a function from it.
